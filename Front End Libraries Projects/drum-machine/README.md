This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Drum Machine App

Built as a solution to a [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) challange, the [Build a Drum Machine] challenge. Best viewed with a webkit browser.

## Frameworks

This app has been built using [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org) and [Bootstrap](https://reactjs.org). Locally built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) before being migrated to [Codepen](https://codepen.io).

## Known Issues

- The app is not suitable for smartphones currently. Tested on an iPhone XR, layout is not optimized and Safari does not preload the audio.
- On Edge, audio is distorted and is not preloaded.

## Codepen Sample

A running example of the app can be found here: [Codepen Link](TODO)
